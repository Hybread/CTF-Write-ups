# Introduction
BATxAPU Cyber Tradition Battles 2024 was an annual mini-CTF and beginner-friendly, forensics-focused CTF competition which is held by BAT in collaboration with my university APU. I had the pleasure of participating
in this competition with my team `nas1g3puk` which consisted of some of my classmates and I. This competition was very different compared to a standard CTF where it's usually just a jeopardy-style online platform CTF.
The competition consisted of 2 stages, preliminaries, and finals (top 20 teams from prelim). The prelims was 6 hours long, split into 4 parts and each part. Instead of the standard way of getting points JUST
from CTF challenges, the participants on each round, had a set amount of time to play a Malaysian, traditional game such as Congkak, Ting-Ting, and such to rack up points. After the games, come the CTF challenges
which are published for us to solve for another set amount of time. After it was all and done, we manage to make it into the Top 20 teams where it moves onto an OVERNIGHT challenge.

Each team was given a random hard difficulty challenge from a pool of 4 challenges to be solved overnight. The one we got was based on Digital Forensics. To summarize, post-prelims, I spent 4-5 hours staying back
at the campus to solve the challenge which I eventually did and went home super tired. But, it was all worth it as my team and I managed to secure a 4th runner-up finish!
