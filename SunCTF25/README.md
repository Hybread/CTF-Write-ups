# SunCTF 2025
## Introduction
SunCTF is Sunway University's largest CTF competition, being hosted once a year. They started hosting their own CTF competition last year and it was only open internally for Sunway Uni students.
This year however, Sunway University decided to open the competition up for participants locally. I had the honour of taking on this competition with two of my friends whilst
representing my startup group CYNX (CyberNexus), which was what we named our team. We managed to place 10th out of 81 teams which wasn't bad at all considering it has been a while since
any of us participated in a CTF competition!

For the challenges, these were the categories that I personally took on:
- Cryptography
- Reverse Engineering
- Pwn/Binary Exploitation

I hope you'll enjoy reading my writeups on the challenges I solved!
