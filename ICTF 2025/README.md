# APU Internal CTF 2025
## Introduction
This was a inter-house CTF competition created by the FSec (Forensic and Cyber Security Research Centre) division of my university. I participated with 2 other friends of mine and out of 145 teams, we managed to place 3rd overall. The placement isn't the main point of me participating in this competition, but the experience that I gained from it. This was my 2nd ever physical CTF competition that I participated and with this participation, I have gained a LOT more confidence in my communications, team coordination and problem solving skills. Though we were pressured with time, we managed to keep ourselves composed (for the most part) and secure this placement.
Anyways, enough rambling. This git directory contains the questions that I solved within the competition's timeframe. Enjoy!

**Side note: I made a slip up and forgot to add a team name when registering, so they defaulted to the Captain's name lol**
