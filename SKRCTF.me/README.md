# Introduction
SKRCTF.me is a beginner-friendly CTF website filled with challenges of all standard categories in CTF. This is the website I used to start my journey in CTF before I started joining CTF competitions.
I used this site to brush up my skills on Cryptography and to learn the basics of Reverse Engineering. 

Do note that all the writeups that I post under this directory are PRACTICE and/or REVISION solves.
