# Introduction 
This challenge was initially made as a fun little self project to share with my fellow peers. Just for me to have a taste of what a real challenge creator goes through. Little did I know I’d be in collaboration with my lecturer Mr. Shahab Alizadeh, as he seemed to have seen a potential in this challenge creation. With advice and little guidelines on how the difficulty should be tuned, I went back and bungkus’d myself for the past 5 days (29/03/2025 23:34pm as of writing this). I have lacked sleep, lowered my focus on certain subjects and skipped meals, purely due to the amount of passion I have for creating this CTF challenge as it was my very first time doing so. What I have done to myself carries no influence from Mr. Shahab, as he had simply shown me an opportunity to grow what I have made initially as a joke, and it was by my own judgement to do what I have gone through. I’m speaking as if this has become something big, but in reality I'm just barely scratching the tip of the iceberg. Nevertheless, I present to you the step-by-step solve for my very own CTF challenge: SandwichThief!
