# Introduction
This was one of the first few competitions I participated in. It was a large-scale annual CTF competition hosted by HackTheBox and was actually meant for 20 members per team, but I participated with only 3 of my friends. 

Nonetheless, I tried my best with the little knowledge I know and got to solve a few "Very Easy" and "Easy" rated challenges. I was stumped on the "Medium" Reverse Engineering challenge and was lost for the "Hard" ones.
After the competition ended, HTB released the official writeups and after going through them, especially the Reverse ones, I found out quickly that the knowledge I had coming in to this competition was nothing close to being sufficient.

But, we will always learn and improve and that's what I'm going for! All and all it was an amazing experience and to have the honor of experiencing HackTheBox's Cyber Apocalypse CTF 2025 competition and reading the official writeups, I could clearly see the many parts of CTF and hacking knowledge that I have to improve on.
