# A New Hire 
## Solve
Download the given file. We see that it is an ‘Email’ message file. Open it and we are greeted with this:

At the bottom it hints to us that we must access the ‘resume’ given the following link: 
```
storage.microsoftcloudservices.com:[PORT]/index.php 
```

Since we’ve gotten the port number from the docker, let’s try to access the site:

It just seems like a normal resume page but with a button on the center that does nothing when clicked (or so it seems). Instead let’s view the source code of the webpage. 

Now we get to see HTML source code. After scrolling for a bit, a JavaScript function can be seen at the end of the code: 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/56bb3a23-ebfa-4946-868d-5b0fec9694d3)

We find: 
```
window.location.href = `search:displayname=Downloads&subquery=\\\\${window.location.hostname}@${window.location.port}\\3fe1690d955e8fd2a0b282501570e1f4\\resumes\\` 
```

If we follow the string we got but sub in actual url formatters, we end up with: 
```
http://storage.microsoftcloudservices.com:port/3fe1690d955e8fd2a0b282501570e1f4/resumes/
```

We get access to the webpage. Now let’s snoop around:

When we click on configs, we see a python file called ‘client.py’. Let’s download it and open it:

Here we got a python script to decode two lines of ciphertext. Let's decode each one. 

After running it through a Base64 decoder for the ‘key’ variable, we get our flag!
```
Flag = HTB{4PT_28_4nd_m1cr0s0ft_s34rch=1n1t14l_4cc3s!!}
```
