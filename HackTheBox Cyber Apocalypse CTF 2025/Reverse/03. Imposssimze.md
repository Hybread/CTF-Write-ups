We get an ASCII art kind of program:

Seems like no inputs can be taken but arrow keys move the bolded ‘X’ in the middle around which correlates with the CTF challenge name of possibly a maze. 

Let’s decompile the program file on IDA to get a better picture on what’s going on: 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4b1d935a-d2bd-4603-9247-2ca31294cfd5)

From the code, and it’s functions initscr(), cbreak(), noecho(), curs_set(0), and keypad(stdscr, 1), we can tell that the program is using the ncurses library which is used for terminal-based user interfaces like ASCII art or handling keyboard inputs in text-based environment. 

We can see that the program takes the terminal’s dimensions using getmaxy() and getmaxx() functions hinting the x and y axis. 

For the player movement the program goes into a for() loop that retrieves the user input with the wgetch() function. For the “i != 113” line, 113 translated to ASCII is ‘q’. This means that the program is exited if ‘q’ were to be pressed. 

Then, the program listens for arrow key inputs: 
```
- 260: Left arrow (v15-- if v15 > 1). 
- 261: Right arrow (v15++). 
- 258: Down arrow (v16++). 
- 259: Up arrow (v16-- if v16 > 1). 
```

Regardless, it doesn't really do anything. But if we scroll down further we find another section of the code which shows this: 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4fd040cb-5400-4a06-bd7f-236c0a880c5e)

Showing that if the terminal size is exactly 37 columns wide and 13 rows tall (v14 == 37 and v9 == 13), it will display something. On line 95 it shows that the ‘something’ is drawn at row 6, columns 6 to 29 using data from 'byte_4120[*v10]', where v10 points to an array starting at 'unk_40C0', where the array most likely contains indices into ‘byte_4120’ which may hold the flag’s characters. 

This tells us that we must adjust the terminal to 37 columns and 13 rows so let’s do that with the command “stty rows 13 cols 37” and “stty size” to confirm the size:

Now we run the file and sure enough we see the flag being displayed: 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ed52fab4-71c7-412f-aa74-ed03183a75f0)
```
Flag = HTB{th3_curs3_is_brok3n}
```
