Within the folder, we can find a file named "challenge" yet again.

Disassemble the file with Ghidra, then go to decrypt_message() function 

Within the function we find: 
```
IUC|t2nqm4`gm5h`5s2uin4u2d~ 
```
Then, analyze the for loop, put the encrypted message into shifting cipher decoder and we get the flag:
```
Flag: HTB{s1mpl3_fl4g_4r1thm3t1c}
```
